In a small island of Singapore, it is common to see many high-rise residences, known as HDB
flats, which are managed by the Housing and Development Board. They are scattered in the
different regions and planning areas in Singapore, but are they created equal, or are there
some planning areas where it is more conducive to live in? With this question in mind, the
data that we have used will contain both spatial information and non-spatial information that
could help us derive meaningful insights.
